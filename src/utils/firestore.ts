// Ultimately, we have a problem because our "core" types include references to firestore
// constructs, such as snapshots and documents, however, they can either be firebase-admin or
// standard firebase objects. The mismatch in type definitions between firebase and firebase-admin
// prevent us from importing either or both libraries into our core package, and using those
// official type definitions. Instead, we use loose duck-typing for now, and in some cases, resort
// to using any types. We do this for now because our core library isn't really used in this regard
// - to derive correct firestore types through our schema and other core objects. Instead, we just
// provide basic ducktypes to prevent type errors. We should probably come back to this in future so
// our types are correct.
