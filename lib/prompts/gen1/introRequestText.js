We have identified that the provider can potentially help the seeker with what the seeker is asking for. Now the seeker would like to write a polite and to-the-point email to the provider, to ask for a chat on the said subject. The email should 1)introduce briefly who the asker is. 2) Why he or she is reaching out 3) ask for a chat. Please help the seeker draft this email to maximize the chance of the provider responding to the email. Please don't include a suggested subject line.

E.g. "Dear [PROVIDER_NAME], I hope this email finds you well. My name is [SEEKER_NAME] and we both belong to [COMMUNITY_NAME],."
